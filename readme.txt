== Description ==
Checks Domain WHOIS Lookup for availability. Simple insert the [pwhois] shortcode on a page or post. 
To select the default TLD use the default attribute: [pwhois default=com] - sets .com as default in the TLD dropdown.
TLD List is limited because of the knowledge of the required whois servers. If you wish to have support for a special TLD please contact me and I will implement it asap.
